0.2.6 (2017-12-01)
==================

*   Removed ghc-7.6.3 and versions of wai<3.0 from the CI test matrix.
    These versions are still supported in the code but cabal may need some
    manual help to resolve dependencies.

*   Fixes and improvements to the documentation. Thanks to Frederik HanghÃ¸j
    Iversen, Alex Collins, and Maximilian Tagher.

*   Removed dependencies on parsers package.

0.2.4
=====

*   Fix [bug #1](https://github.com/larskuhtz/wai-cors/issues/1).
    Response header `Vary: Origin` is now included when `corsVaryOrigin`

0.2.3
=====

*   Added a test-suite to the package that uses PhantomJS to simulate a
    browser client.

*   Pass on websocket requests unchanged to the application. Add documentation
    that reminds the application author to check the `Origin` header for
    websocket requests.

    to https://github.com/larskuhtz/wai-cors.

    Accept empty list as value for `Access-Control-Request-Headers`.

0.2
===

This version may break existing code by changing the type of
`CorsResourcePolicy`.

This version changes the behavior of `simpleCorsResourcePolicy`: Before
it was a failure when the request didn't contain an @Origin@ header.
With this version the request is passed unchanged to the application.
If an failure occurs during CORS processing the response has HTTP status
400 (bad request) and contains a short error messages. This behavior
can be changed with the new settings `corsRequireOrigin` and
`corsIgnorefailure`.

*   Remove setting `corsVerboseResponse` from `CorsResourcePolicy`.

*   Add new settings `corsRequireOrigin` and `corsIgnoreFailure` to
    `CorsResourcePolicy`.

=====

*   Support wai-3

0.1.3
=====

*   Improved documentation

0.1.2
=====

*   New easy-to-use middleware function `simpleCors` that supports just
    simple cross-origin requests

*   The new value `simpleCorseResourcePolicy` is a `CorseResourcePolicy`
    for simple cross-origin requests.

*   Documentation has been slightly improved

*   Some code for testing `simpleCors` from a browser

*   Drop redundant dependencies on *lens* and *ghc-prim*
